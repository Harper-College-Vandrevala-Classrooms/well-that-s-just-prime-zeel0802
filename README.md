# Well That's Just Prime - Java Template

## Instructions

You can find the instructions for this lab [here](https://cyrusvandrevala.com/teaching/csc/214/labs/well-thats-just-prime.html).

In this lab, you will update both the source file and test file. Your implementation will live in `src/main/java/com/csc/Factorizer.java` and your tests will live in `src/test/java/com/csc/TestFactorizer.java`.

## Testing

If you are using an IDE like Visual Studio, there are built-in utilities that will recognize the Gradle build file and allow you to run the tests.

If you want to run the tests from the command line, follow these steps:

1. Install the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) build tool.
2. From the root of the project, type `gradle` into the command line. This will set up and build the project.
3. From the root of the project, type `gradle test` into the command line. This will run all of the automated tests.
